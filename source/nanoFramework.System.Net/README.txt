After updating the Nuget package(s)

1. After updating the Nuget packages, the project file (nfproj extension) has to be manually edited too in order to update the path for the new package for all <NFMDP_PE_LoadHints> tags.

2. The nuproj files (in nanoFramework.System.Net.Nuget.sln) have to be manually updated for the dependency versions to match the referenced packages.
